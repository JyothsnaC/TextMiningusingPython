Every country has its own unique local taste and cuisine. In todayâ€™s world, the ease of accessibility of recipes of different cuisines over the internet on various food websites has increased tremendously. We have restaurants serving different cuisines, making food from various parts of the world available in most major cities.  
Our aim is to build a model that can accurately predict the category of the cuisine based on the ingredients used in the recipe. The data is from a food website that contains the information of ingredients used in various cuisines. During the predictive modelling process, four classification models-Decision tree, Logistic regression, Random forest, Neural networks are built. The precision, recall and F1 scores are calculated to rate the performance of the models. Based on this, Logistic Regression is found to be the best model. 
By doing this, the food website will be more customer friendly and improve the search ability of recipes on the website.
